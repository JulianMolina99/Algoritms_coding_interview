# Algoritms coding interview
## Algorithms

Algorithmic thinking is a fundamental skill that should be developed not only in the field of programming and engineering but in all areas of life that require solving a specific problem. This project contains the solution in JavaScript code to some of the most common algorithms in job interviews. The programming exercises are free and can be found on the freeCodeCamp website at the following link: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/.

Description of the freeCodeCamp section: "These free programming exercises will teach you about some common algorithms that you will likely encounter in real life. They are a great opportunity to improve your logic and programming skills. These algorithms are frequently used in job interviews to test a candidate's skills. We'll give you clear and concise explanations of how these different algorithms work so you can implement a solution for each one".
